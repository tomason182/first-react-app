      <p>
        Warm-hearted and dedicated Sergeant in the Royal Spanish Army with over
        a decade of service in Los Angeles. Known for my friendly demeanor,
        unwavering loyalty, and knack for turning everyday situations into
        comedic adventures. While I might not always catch the cunning Zorro, my
        passion for duty and love for the community shine through. Seeking a
        position in the esteemed household of Don Diego de la Vega where I can
        bring joy, security, and perhaps a delicious meal or two.
